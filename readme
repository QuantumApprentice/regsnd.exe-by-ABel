//NOTE from Quantum//
I'm uploading this source code along with a newly compiled version
of the executable here for others to easily get access to.
@ABel, if you're available I would love to directly link your own repo.



  ACM registration utility
     v1.4 for Fallout 2
 (c) 2001-2004 ABel [TeamX]
============================

*** What is this for ***
This program updates SNDLIST.LST file with information about new and
changed ACM-files in <Fallout2 installation dir>\DATA\SOUND\SFX.

*** Alternatives ***
The BIS Mapper2 can rebuild the SNDLIST.LST, if it is deleted (both from
master.dat and from disk). The Fallout2 also recreates the list file, but it
inserts zeros instead of sequential file-tags.

*** Installation ***
Just extract REGSND.EXE, and SNDLIST.LST file (it is located in
MASTER.DAT archive) into <Fallout2 installation dir>\DATA\SOUND\SFX
directory.

*** Distribution ***
Free, source code included.

*** Feedback ***
Please, report errors to abel@krasu.ru or return0@pisem.net
